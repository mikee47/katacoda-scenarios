Prerequisites: experience with C/C++ and Unix shell.

Since recently the `develop` branch of [Sming Framework](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming) comes with a Host Emulator. The Sming Host Emulator(SHE) allows Sming applications to be built as an executable to run on the development host (Windows or Linux).

This is a source-level emulator for developing and testing new framework code prior to flashing a real device.

This is not a machine emulator; if you need something operating at a lower level take a look at [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

This tutorial will demonstrate how SHE can be used during development for finding and analyzing problems easier and for testing your code before flashing it on a real device.
