# Sming Framework

Sming Framework comes with multiple components that need to be built in a library that our sample applications will use. The build process requires fetching code from other open source projects, patching and compiling all components. To execute the build execute the commands below:

```
cd $SMING_HOME
make
```{{execute}}


Sit back and relax until the framework library gets compiled. This will take a while.
Once the build process has finished go to the next step.
